# make-sail (working title)

Motivation
----------
Initially started as my entry for [LOWREZJAM 2017](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2017).
But since I couldn't find enough time to implement proper gameplay and fix the collision detection, I've put the project on ice.

Technology
----------
* [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)
* gulp for building from source
* [rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup)
* SASS and pug for the HTML container


Install
-------
1. `git clone https://github.com/Thunraz/make-sail`
2. `npm i`
3. `gulp watch`
4. Open browser to http://localhost:8080/. There is no live reload for now.
